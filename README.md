# ERC-20
Swisstronik Challenge

Create and deploy an ERC20 contract, mint at least 100 tokens using Hardhat, and publish the code in a public GitHub repository 
Hints: 
1. You can use OpenZeppelin Contracts Wizard to create the ERC20 mintable token 
2. For token minting, you can use SwisstronikJS to interact with the contract. Alternatively, you can opt to mint directly during the deployment phase (constructor).
